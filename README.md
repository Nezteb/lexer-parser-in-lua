# lexer-parser-in-lua
This is for a programming languages class I'm in. Both assignments have already been turned in for the class, so I'm uploading my submissions here for my own future reference (not for cheating).

`lexit.lua` is the lexer I wrote.
`lexit_test.lua` is the test for the lexer (written by my professor).
`spt15.lua` is the parser I wrote.
`spt15_test.lua` is the test for the parser (written by my professor).

You should use at least Lua 5.2 for all of this.
